"Combined with self-developed camera synchronization, auto exposure, and white balance control "
"camera technology, MYNT® EYE S Series provides a CUDA-based GPU real-time acceleration solution "
"that outputs high-precision, synchronized image sources to help reduce the difficulty of algorithm "
"development and speed up the efficiency of algorithm research and development. At the same time, "
"MYNT EYE S is equipped with a six-axis sensor (IMU) and an infrared active light (IR). Among them, "
"six-axis sensor (IMU) can provide data complementation and correction for the research of visual "
"positioning algorithm, suitable for algorithm research of visual inertial odometer (VIO), help "
"improve positioning accuracy; infrared active light (IR) can help solve the problem of identifying "
"indoor white walls and non-textured objects, and improve the recognition accuracy of image "
"sources. The difference between MYNT EYE SE and MYNT EYE S is that MYNT EYE SE does not include IR "
"and offers customers with lower cost hardware. MYNT EYE SC provides 8cm/12cm optional baseline "
"solution, super wide angle 146°FOV, providing a wider depth recognition range and accuracy level, "
"with color image sensor, upgraded brand new BMI088 six-axis IMU, IR active light, I2C time "
"synchronization Chip, global shutter, etc., with resolutions up to 1280x800/60fps and accuracy is "
"up to centimeters. In addition, MYNT EYE S Series also provides a rich SDK interface and VSLAM "
"open source project support, which can help customers quickly integrate solutions, accelerate the "
"product development process, and achieve rapid productization and implementation."
