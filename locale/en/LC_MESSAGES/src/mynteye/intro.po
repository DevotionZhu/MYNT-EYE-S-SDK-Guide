"结合自研的帧同步、自动曝光及白平衡控制等摄像头技术，小觅双目摄像头（MYNT® "
"EYE）标准版可以输出高精度同步的图像源，帮助降低算法研发难度，加快算法研发效率。同时，标准版产品标配六轴传感器（IMU）和红外主动光探测器（IR）。其中，六轴传感器（IMU）可为视觉定位算法的研究提供数据的互补和校正，适用于视觉惯性里程计（VIO）的算法研究，帮助提升定位精度；红外主动光探测器（IR）可以帮助解决室内白墙和无纹理物体的识别难题，提升图像源的识别精度。"
msgstr "Using camera techniques such as frame synchronization, automatic exposure, and white balance control, the MYNT® EYE Standard Edition can produce synchronized image sources with high-precision, which decreases the difficulty of algorithms development, thus increasing efficiency. The standard version comes with six-axis sensor(IMU) and an infrared active light detector (IR). Among them, the six-axis sensor(IMU) can provide complementarity and correction of data from the visual positioning algorithms, and is suitable for visual inertial odometry(VIO) algorithms research to help improve the positioning accuracy. The infrared active light detector (IR) can help solve the problem of identification of objects such as indoor white walls and non-textured objects, as well as enhance the accuracy of image source recognition."
