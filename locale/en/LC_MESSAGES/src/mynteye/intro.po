"结合自研的帧同步、自动曝光及白平衡控制等摄像头技术，小觅双目摄像头（MYNT® "
"EYE）标准版可以输出高精度同步的图像源，帮助降低算法研发难度，加快算法研发效率。同时，标准版产品标配六轴传感器（IMU）和红外主动光探测器（IR）。其中，六轴传感器（IMU）可为视觉定位算法的研究提供数据的互补和校正，适用于视觉惯性里程计（VIO）的算法研究，帮助提升定位精度；红外主动光探测器（IR）可以帮助解决室内白墙和无纹理物体的识别难题，提升图像源的识别精度。"
msgstr "With self-development camera techniques, such as frame synchronization, automatic exposure, and white balance control, etc. MYNT® EYE standard version can output high-precision synchronized image source, and help reduce the difficulty of algorithms development。At the same time, it is equipped with six axis sensor (IMU) and Infrared active light detector (IR). Six axis sensor (IMU) can provides complementary and correction for the research of visual positioning algorithms, also be applicable for the research of Visual inertial mileage algorithms (VIO), it helps improve positioning precision. Infrared active light detector (IR) can help to resolve the problem that it is difficult to recognize the indoor white wall and no-textured objects, and improve the precision of image source recognition,"
